When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would like to use a remote repository when I am working with a lot many people in a group or when I am creating a new open source project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It might be possible that other people would be working and contributing in the same branch. In such a case, automatically pulling changes is most likely to disturb the streamline of development. Manually pulling changes gives you the independence to get your piece of code completed and then pull and merge changes made by others.
